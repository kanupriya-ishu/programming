/*
Given an array of n positive integers and a number k. Find the minimum number of swaps required to bring all the numbers less than or equal to k together.

Example 1:

Input : arr[ ] = {2, 1, 5, 6, 3} and K = 3
Output : 1
Explanation:
To bring elements 2, 1, 3 together, swap element '5' with '3'
such that final array will be- arr[] = {2, 1, 3, 6, 5}

Example 2:

Input : arr[ ] = {2, 7, 9, 5, 8, 7, 4} and K = 6 
Output :  2
