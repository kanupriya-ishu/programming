Question:
Given a NxN matrix of positive integers. There are only three possible moves from a cell Matrix[r][c].

Matrix [r+1] [c]
Matrix [r+1] [c-1]
Matrix [r+1] [c+1]
â€‹Starting from any column in row 0, return the largest sum of any of the paths up to row N-1.


Example 1:

Input: N = 2
Matrix = {{348, 391},
          {618, 193}}
Output: 1009
Explaination: The best path is 391 -> 618. 
It gives the sum = 1009.

Example 2:

Input: N = 2
Matrix = {{2, 2},
          {2, 2}}
Output: 4
Explaination: No matter which path is 
chosen, the output is 4.

Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maximumPath() which takes the size N and the Matrix as input parameters and returns the highest maximum path sum.
