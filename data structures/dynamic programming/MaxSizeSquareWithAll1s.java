Question:
Given a binary matrix mat of size n * m, find out the maximum size square sub-matrix with all 1s.

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, m = 2
mat = {{1, 1}, 
       {1, 1}}
Output: 2
Explaination: The maximum size of the square
sub-matrix is 2. The matrix itself is the 
maximum sized sub-matrix in this case.

Example 2:

Input: n = 2, m = 2
mat = {{0, 0}, 
       {0, 0}}
Output: 0
Explaination: There is no 1 in the matrix.
