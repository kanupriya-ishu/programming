Question:
A and B are playing a game. At the beginning there are n coins. Given two more numbers x and y. In each move a player can pick x or y or 1 coins. A always starts the game. The player who picks the last coin wins the game or the person who is not able to pick any coin loses the game. For a given value of n, find whether A will win the game or not if both are playing optimally.

Examples: 

Input :  n = 5, x = 3, y = 4
Output : A
There are 5 coins, every player can pick 1 or
3 or 4 coins on his/her turn.
A can win by picking 3 coins in first chance.
Now 2 coins will be left so B will pick one 
coin and now A can win by picking the last coin.
