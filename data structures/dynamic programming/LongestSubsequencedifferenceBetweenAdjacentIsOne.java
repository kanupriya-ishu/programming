/*
Question:
Given an array A[] of size N, find the longest subsequence such that difference between adjacent elements is one.


Example 1:

Input: N = 7
A[] = {10, 9, 4, 5, 4, 8, 6}
Output: 3
Explaination: The three possible subsequences 
{10, 9, 8} , {4, 5, 4} and {4, 5, 6}.

Example 2:

Input: N = 5
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output: 5
Explaination: All the elements can be 
included in the subsequence.
