Question:
Consider a game where a player can score 3 or 5 or 10 points in a move. Given a total score n, find number of distinct combinations to reach the given score.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T testcases follow.The first line of each test case is n.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print number of ways/combinations to reach the given score.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000

Example:
Input
3
8
20
13
Output
1
4
2
Explanation
For 1st example when n = 8
{ 3, 5 } and {5, 3} are the two possible permutations but these represent the same cobmination. Hence output is 1.
