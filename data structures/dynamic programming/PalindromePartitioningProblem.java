Question:
Given a string str, a partitioning of the string is a palindrome partitioning if every sub-string of the partition is a palindrome. Determine the fewest cuts needed for palindrome partitioning of given string.


Example 1:

Input: str = "ababbbabbababa"
Output: 3
Explaination: After 3 partitioning substrings 
are "a", "babbbab", "b", "ababa".
Example 2:

Input: str = "aaabba"
Output: 1
Explaination: The substrings after 1
partitioning are "aa" and "abba".
