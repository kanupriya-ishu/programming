Question:
A sequence {x1, x2, .. xn} is alternating sequence if its elements satisfy one of the following relations :
x1 < x2 > x3 < x4 > x5..... or  x1 >x2 < x3 > x4 < x5.....
Your task is to find the longest such sequence.

Example 1:

Input: nums = {1,5,4}
Output: 3
Explanation: The entire sequenece is a 
alternating sequence.

Example 2:

Input: nums = {1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8}
Ooutput: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences
that achieve this length. 
One is {1,17,10,13,10,16,8}.
