/*
Question:

Given a boolean expression S of length N with following symbols.
Symbols
    'T' ---> true
    'F' ---> false
and following operators filled between symbols
Operators
    &   ---> boolean AND
    |   ---> boolean OR
    ^   ---> boolean XOR
Count the number of ways we can parenthesize the expression so that the value of expression evaluates to true.

 

Example 1:

Input: N = 7
S = T|T&F^T
Output: 4
Explaination: The expression evaluates 
to true in 4 ways ((T|T)&(F^T)), 
(T|(T&(F^T))), (((T|T)&F)^T) and (T|((T&F)^T)).

Example 2:

Input: N = 5
S = T^F|F
Output: 2
Explaination: ((T^F)|F) and (T^(F|F)) are the 
only ways.
