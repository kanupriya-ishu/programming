Question:
Given an array arr[] of distinct integers of size N and a sum value X, the task is to find count of triplets with the sum smaller than the given sum value X.


Example 1:

Input: N = 4, X = 2
arr[] = {-2, 0, 1, 3}
Output:  2
Explanation: Below are triplets with 
sum less than 2 (-2, 0, 1) and (-2, 0, 3). 

Example 2:

Input: N = 5, X = 12
arr[] = {5, 1, 3, 4, 7}
Output: 4
Explanation: Below are triplets with 
sum less than 12 (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), 
(1, 3, 7) and (1, 4, 5).
